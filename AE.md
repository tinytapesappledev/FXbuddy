## Methods

### clearOutput()

`clearOutput()`

#### Description

Clears the output in the Info panel.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### currentFormatToTime()

`currentFormatToTime(formattedTime, fps[, isDuration])`

#### Description

Converts a formatted string for a frame time value to a number of seconds, given a specified frame rate. For example, if the formatted frame time value is 0:00:12 (the exact string format is determined by a project setting), and the frame rate is 24 fps, the time would be 0.5 seconds (12/24). If the frame rate is 30 fps, the time would be 0.4 seconds (12/30). If the time is a duration, the frames are counted from 0. Otherwise, the frames are counted from the project's starting frame (see [Project.displayStartFrame](project.md#projectdisplaystartframe)).

#### Parameters

|    Parameter    |                                                                        Description                                                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `formattedTime` | The frame time value, a string specifying a number of frames in the project's current time display format.                                                 |
| `fps`           | The frames-per-second, a floating-point value.                                                                                                             |
| `isDuration`    | Optional. When `true`, the time is a duration (measured from frame 0). When `false` (the default), the time is measured from the project's starting frame. |

#### Returns

Floating-point value, the number of seconds.

---

### generateRandomNumber()

`generateRandomNumber()`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 13.6 (CC 2015)

#### Description

Generates random numbers. This function is recommended instead of `Math.random()` for generating random numbers that will be applied as values in a project (e.g., when using setValue).

This method avoids a problem where `Math.random()` would not return random values in After Effects CC 2015 (13.5.x) due to a concurrency issue with multiple CPU threads.

#### Returns

Floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range `[0..1]`.

#### Example

```javascript
// change the position X of all layers with random number

var myComp = app.project.activeItem;
var x = 0;

for (var i = 1; i <= myComp.numLayers; i++) {
    // If you use Math.random(), this does not work
    // x = 400 * (Math.random()) - 200;
    // use new generateRandomNumber() instead

    x = 400 * generateRandomNumber() - 200;
    var currentPos = myComp.layer(i).property("Position").value;
    myComp.layer(i).property("Position").setValue([currentPos[0] + x, currentPos[1]]);
}
```

---

### getEnumAsString()

`getEnumAsString()`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.0

#### Description

Returns the string value of an Enum.

#### Parameters

Enum.

#### Returns

String.

#### Example

```javascript
// Returns: "BlendingMode.ADD"
alert(getEnumAsString(5220));
```

---

### isValid()

`isValid(obj)`

#### Description

Determines if the specified After Effects object (e.g., composition, layer, mask, etc.) still exists. Some operations, such as [PropertyBase.moveTo()](../property/propertybase.md#propertybasemoveto), might invalidate existing variable assignments to related objects. This function allows you to test whether those assignments are still valid before attempting to access them.

#### Parameters

| Parameter |                   Description                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `obj`     | The After Effects object to check for validity. |

#### Returns

Boolean.

#### Example

```javascript
var layer = app.project.activeItem.layer(1); // assume layer has three masks
alert(isValid(layer)); // displays "true"
var mask1 = layer.mask(1);
var mask2 = layer.mask(2);
var mask3 = layer.mask(3);
mask3.moveTo(1); // move the third mask to the top of the mask stack
alert(isValid(mask1)); // displays "false"; mask2 and mask3 do as well
```

---

### timeToCurrentFormat()

`timeToCurrentFormat(time, fps[, isDuration])`

#### Description

Converts a numeric time value (a number of seconds) to a frame time value; that is, a formatted string thatshows which frame corresponds to that time, at the specified rate. For example, if the time is 0.5 seconds, andthe frame rate is 24 fps, the frame would be 0:00:12 (when the project is set to display as timecode). If the framerate is 30 fps, the frame would be 0:00:15. The format of the timecode string is determined by a project setting. If the time is a duration, the frames are counted from 0. Otherwise, the frames are counted from the project's starting frame (see [Project displayStartFrame](project.md#projectdisplaystartframe) attribute).

#### Parameters

|  Parameter   |                                                                      Description                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `time`       | The number of seconds, a floating-point value.                                                                                                         |
| `fps`        | The frames-per-second, a floating-point value.                                                                                                         |
| `isDuration` | Optional. When `true`, the time is a duration (measured from frame 0). When `false` (the default), the time is measured from the project's starting frame. |

#### Returns

String in the project's current time display format.

### app.exitAfterLaunchAndEval

`app.exitAfterLaunchAndEval`

#### Description

This attribute is used only when executing a script from a command line on Windows. When the application is launched from the command line, the `-r` or `-s` command line flag causes the application to run a script (from a file or from a string, respectively).

If this attribute is set to `true`, After Effects will exit after the script is run; if it is `false`, the application will remain open. This attribute only has an effect when After Effects is run from the Windows command line. It has no effect in Mac OS.

#### Type

Boolean; read/write.

- `ToolType.Tool_PenConvert`: Convert Vertex Tool
- `ToolType.Tool_Pin`: Puppet Pin Tool
- `ToolType.Tool_PinStarch`: Puppet Starch Tool
- `ToolType.Tool_PinDepth`: Puppet Overlap Tool
- `ToolType.Tool_Quickselect`: Roto Brush Tool
- `ToolType.Tool_Hairbrush`: Refine Edge Tool

#### Examples

The following sample code checks the current tool, and if it is not the Unified Camera Tool, sets the current tool to that:

```javascript
// Check the current tool, then set it to Unified Camera Tool (UCT).
// Assume a composition is selected in the project.
var comp = app.project.activeItem;
if (comp instanceof CompItem) {
    // Add a camera to the current comp. (Requirement for UCT)
    var cameraLayer = comp.layers.addCamera("Test Camera", [comp.width / 2, comp.height / 2]);
    comp.openInViewer();

    // If the currently selected tool is not one of the camera tools, set it to UCT.
    if (( app.project.toolType !== ToolType.Tool_CameraMaya) &&
        ( app.project.toolType !== ToolType.Tool_CameraOrbit ) &&
        ( app.project.toolType !== ToolType.Tool_CameraTrackXY) &&
        ( app.project.toolType !== ToolType.Tool_CameraTrackZ)) {
            app.project.toolType = ToolType.Tool_CameraMaya;
        }
}
```

The following sample code uses the new app.project.toolType attribute to create a 360-degrees composition (environment layer and camera) from a selected footage item or composition selected in the Project panel. This script a good starting point for building VR compositions from equirectangular footage:

```javascript
// Create a 360 VR comp from a footage item or comp selected in the Project panel.

var item = app.project.activeItem;
if (item !== null && (item.typeName === "Footage" || item.typeName === "Composition")) {
    // Create a comp with the footage.
    var comp = app.project.items.addComp(item.name, item.width, item.height, item.pixelAspect, item.duration, item.frameRate);
    var layers = comp.layers;
    var footageLayer = layers.add(item);

    // Apply the CC Environment effect and create a camera.
    var effect = footageLayer.Effects.addProperty("CC Environment");
    var camera = layers.addCamera("360 Camera", [item.width / 2, item.height / 2]);
    comp.openInViewer();
    app.project.toolType = ToolType.Tool_CameraMaya;
} else {
    alert("Select a single footage item or composition in the Project panel.");
}
```

### Project.usedFonts

`app.project.usedFonts`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.5

#### Description

Returns an Array of Objects containing references to used fonts and the Text Layers and times on which they appear in the current [Project](#project-object).

Each object is composed of `font` which is a [Font object](../text/fontobject.md), and `usedAt` which is an Array of Objects, each composed of `layerID`, a [Layer.id](../layer/layer.md#layerid), and `layerTimeD` for when. See [Project.layerByID()](#projectlayerbyid) to retrieve the layers.

```javascript
var usedList = app.project.usedFonts;
if (usedList.length) {
    var font = usedList[0].font;
    var usedAt = usedList[0].usedAt;

    var str = "[0]:" + font.postScriptName + "\n";
    for (var i = 0; i < usedAt.length; i++) {
        var layerID = usedAt[i].layerID;
        // valueAtTime() for Source Text property is expecting timed
        // to be in Layer Time instead of Comp Time, unlike any of
        // the other properties. So we have adjusted the name returned
        // by usedFonts to make this clear as we expect that is where
        // it will be used next.
        var layerTimeD = usedAt[i].layerTimeD;

        var layer = app.project.layerByID(layerID);
        str += "    Layer:'" + String(layer.property("Source Text").valueAtTime(layerTimeD, false)) + "'\n";
    }
    alert(str);
}
```

#### Type

Array of Objects; read-only.

### Project.replaceFont()

`app.project.replaceFont(fromFont, toFont, [noFontLocking = false])`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.5

#### Description

This function will replace all the usages of [Font object](../text/fontobject.md) `fromFont` with [Font object](../text/fontobject.md) `toFont`.

This operation exposes the same mechanism and policy used for automatic font replacement of missing or substituted fonts and is therefore a complete and precise replacement, even on [TextDocuments](../text/textdocument.md) which have mixed styling, preserving the character range the `fromFont` was applied to.

This operation is not undoable.

The optional parameter `noFontLocking` controls what happens when the `toFont` has no glyphs for the text it is applied to. By default a fallback font will be selected which will have the necessary glyphs, but if this parameter is set to `true` then this fallback will not take place and missing glyphs will result. There is no way at the current time to detect or report this.

Note that when `fromFont` is a substituted font and the `toFont` has the same font properties no fallback can occur and the parameter is ignored and treated as `true`.

```javascript
var fromFont = app.project.usedFonts[0].font;
var fontList = app.fonts.getFontsByPostScriptName("TimesNewRomanPSMT");
var toFont = fontList[0];
var layerChanged = app.project.replaceFont(fromFont, toFont);
```

#### Parameters

|    Parameter    |                 Type                 |          Description          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `fromFont`      | [Font object](../text/fontobject.md) | Font to be replaced.          |
| `toFont`        | [Font object](../text/fontobject.md) | Font to replace it with.      |
| `noFontLocking` | Boolean                              | Optional. Defaults to `false` |

#### Returns

Boolean. `true` if at least one Layer was changed.

---

### Project.save()

`app.project.save([file])`

#### Description

Saves the project. The same as the File > Save or File > Save As command. If the project has never previously been saved and no file is specified, prompts the user for a location and file name.

Pass a [File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) object to save a project to a new file without prompting.

#### Parameters

| Parameter |                                              Type                                              |         Description         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `file`    | [Extendscript File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) | Optional. The file to save. |

#### Returns

#### Parameters

| Parameter |                                                Type                                                |       Description        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `folder`  | [Extendscript Folder](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/folder-object.html) | Folder to set as default |

#### Returns

Boolean; indicates if the operation was successful.

#### Examples

Any of the following will set the default import folder to C:/My Folder:

* `var myFolder = new Folder("C:/My Folder"); app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(myFolder);`
* `app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(new Folder("C:/My Folder"));`
* `app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(Folder("C:/My Folder"));`

Note: if the path refers to an existing file and not a folder, the Folder function returns a File object instead of a Folder object, which will cause `setDefaultImportFolder()` to return `false`.

To set the default import folder to the current user's desktop folder: `app.project.setDefaultImportFolder(Folder.desktop);`

To disable the default folder, call `setDefaultImportFolder()` with no parameters: `app.project.setDefaultImportFolder();`

# Item object

`app.project.item(index)`

`app.project.items[index]`


#### Description

The Item object represents an item that can appear in the Project panel. The first item is at index 1.

!!! info
    Item is the base class for [AVItem object](avitem.md) and for [FolderItem object](folderitem.md), which are in turn the base classes for various other item types, so Item attributes and methods are available when working with all of these item types.

#### Example

This example gets the second item from the project and checks that it is a folder. It then removes from the folder any top-level item that is not currently selected. It also checks to make sure that, for each item in the folder, the parent is properly set to the correct folder.

```javascript
var myFolder = app.project.item(2);
if (!(myFolder instanceof FolderItem)) {
    alert("error: second item is not a folder");
} else {
    var numInFolder = myFolder.numItems;
    //Always run loops backwards when deleting things:
    for (var i = numInFolder; i >= 1; i--) {
        var curItem = myFolder.item(i);
        if (curItem.parentFolder !== myFolder) {
            alert("error within AE: the parentFolder is not set correctly");
        } else {
            if (!curItem.selected) {
                //found an unselected solid.
                curItem.remove();

# AVItem object

`app.project.item(index)`

#### Description

The AVItem object provides access to attributes and methods of audio/visual files imported into After Effects.

!!! info
    AVItem is a subclass of Item. All methods and attributes of Item, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with AVItem. See [Item object](item.md)

!!! info
    AVItem is the base class for both CompItem and FootageItem, so AVItem attributes and methods are also available when working with CompItem and FootageItem objects. See [CompItem object](compitem.md) and [FootageItem object](footageitem.md).

!!! warning
    CompItems and FootageItems, while logical descendants of AVItem, are not *really* subclasses of AVItem as AVItem doesn't exist in Extendscript, ie. attempting to check if `item instanceof AVItem` will fail because AVItem is undefined. This is also true for `Item` itself.

See [Javascript Classes](../introduction/javascript.md#javascript-classes) and [After Effects Class Hierarchy](../introduction/classhierarchy.md) for more info.

---

## Attributes

### AVItem.duration

`app.project.item(index).duration`

#### Description

Returns the duration, in seconds, of the item. Still footage items have a duration of 0.

- In a CompItem, the value is linked to the duration of the composition, and is read/write.
- In a FootageItem, the value is linked to the `duration` of the `mainSource` object, and is read-only.

#### Type

Floating-point value, in the range `[0.0..10800.0]`; read/write for a [CompItem](../item/compitem.md); otherwise, read-only.

---

### AVItem.footageMissing

`app.project.item(index).footageMissing`

#### Description

When `true`, the AVItem is a placeholder, or represents footage with a source file that cannot be found. In this case, the path of the missing source file is in the `missingFootagePath` attribute of the footage item's source-file object. See [FootageItem.mainSource](footageitem.md#footageitemmainsource) and [FileSource.missingFootagePath](../sources/filesource.md#filesourcemissingfootagepath).

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### AVItem.frameDuration

`app.project.item(index).frameDuration`

#### Description

Returns the length of a frame for this AVItem, in seconds. This is the reciprocal of `frameRate`. When set, the reciprocal is automatically set as a new `frameRate` value. This attribute returns the reciprocal of the `frameRate`, which may not be identical to a value you set, if that value is not evenly divisible into 1.0 (for example, 0.3). Due to numerical limitations, (1 / (1 / 0.3)) is close to, but not exactly, 0.3. If the AVItem is a FootageItem, this value is linked to the `mainSource`, and is read-only. To change it, set the `conformFrameRate` of the `mainSource` object. This sets both the `frameRate` and `frameDuration` of the FootageItem.

#### Type

Floating-point value, in the range `[1/99..1.0]`; read-only for a [FootageItem](../item/footageitem.md), otherwise read/write.

---

### AVItem.frameRate

`app.project.item(index).frameRate`

#### Description

#### Description

Test whether the AVItem can be used as an alternate source when calling [Property.setAlternateSource()](../property/property.md#propertysetalternatesource).

Returns `true` if the item can be used, or otherwise `false`.

A CompItem or a FootageItem can be used as an alternate source for the layer, with some restrictions:

- If the AVItem is a [FootageItem object](footageitem.md), then FootageItem.FootageSource should not be a [SolidSource object](../sources/solidsource.md).
- If the AVItem is a [FootageItem object](footageitem.md) and the FootageItem.FootageSource is a [FileSource object](../sources/filesource.md) then that FileSource should not point to a non-media file e.g. a JSX script file.
- Setting the AVItem cannot create a cyclical reference within the project.

#### Type

Boolean; read only.

---

### AVItem.name

`app.project.item(index).name`

#### Description

The name of the item, as shown in the Project panel.

### AVItem.proxySource

`app.project.item(index).proxySource`

#### Description

The FootageSource being used as a proxy. The attribute is read-only; to change it, call any of the AVItem methods that change the proxy source: `setProxy()`, `setProxyWithSequence()`, `setProxyWithSolid()`, or `setProxyWithPlaceholder()`.

#### Type
`FootageSource` object; read-only.

---

### AVItem.time

`app.project.item(index).time`

#### Description

The current time of the item when it is being previewed directly from the Project panel. This value is a number of seconds. Use the global method [timeToCurrentFormat()](../general/globals.md#timetocurrentformat) to convert it to a string value that expresses the time in terms of frames. It is an error to set this value for a FootageItem whose `mainSource` is still (`item.mainSource.isStill` is `true`).

#### Type

Floating-point value; read/write.

---

### AVItem.usedIn

`app.project.item(index).usedIn`

#### Description

All the compositions that use this AVItem. Note that upon retrieval, the array value is copied, so it is not automatically updated. If you get this value, then add this item into another composition, you must retrieve the value again to get an array that includes the new item.

#### Type

Array of CompItem objects; read-only.

---

### AVItem.useProxy

`app.project.item(index).useProxy`

#### Description

When `true`, a proxy is used for the item. It is set to `true` by all the `SetProxy` methods, and to `false` by the `SetProxyToNone()` method.

#### Type

Boolean; read/write.

---

### AVItem.width

`app.project.item(index).width`

#### Description

The width of the item, in pixels.

- In a CompItem, the value is linked to the composition, and is read/write.
- In a FootageItem, the value is linked to the `mainSource` object, and is read/write only if the `mainSource` object is a SolidSource. Otherwise, it is read-only.

#### Type

Integer, in the range `[1..30000]`; read/write, except as noted.

---

## Methods

### AVItem.setProxy()

`app.project.item(index).setProxy(file)`

#### Description

Sets a file as the proxy of this AVItem.

Loads the specified file into a new FileSource object, sets this as the value of the `proxySource` attribute, and sets `useProxy` to `true`.

It does not preserve the interpretation parameters, instead using the user preferences. If the file has an unlabeled alpha channel, and the user preference says to ask the user what to do, the method estimates the alpha interpretation, rather than asking the user.

This differs from setting a FootageItem's `mainSource`, but both actions are performed as in the user interface.

#### Parameters

| Parameter |                                                 Type                                                  |           Description           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `file`    | [Extendscript File](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html) object | The file to be used as a proxy. |

#### Returns

None.

---

### AVItem.setProxyToNone()

`app.project.item(index).setProxyToNone()`

#### Description

Removes the proxy from this AVItem, sets the value of `proxySource` to `null`, and sets the value of `useProxy` to `false`.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### AVItem.setProxyWithPlaceholder()

`app.project.item(index).setProxyWithPlaceholder(name, width, height ,frameRate, duration)`

#### Description

Creates a PlaceholderSource object with specified values, sets this as the value of the `proxySource` attribute, and sets `useProxy` to `true`. It does not preserve the interpretation parameters, instead using the user preferences.

!!! note
    There is no direct way to set a placeholder as a proxy in the user interface; this behavior occurs when a proxy has been set and then moved or deleted.

#### Parameters

|  Parameter  |                  Type                  |                 Description                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | String                                 | The name of the new object.                 |
| `width`     | Integer, in the range `[4..30000]`     | The pixel dimensions of the placeholder.    |
| `height`    | Integer, in the range `[4..30000]`     | The pixel dimensions of the placeholder.    |
| `frameRate` | Integer, in the range `[1..99]`        | Frame rate for the proxy.                   |
| `duration`  | Integer, in the range `[0.0..10800.0]` | The total length in seconds, up to 3 hours. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### AVItem.setProxyWithSequence()

`app.project.item(index).setProxyWithSequence(file,forceAlphabetical)`

#### Description

Sets a sequence of files as the proxy of this AVItem, with the option of forcing alphabetical order.
Loads the specified file sequence into a new FileSource object, sets this as the value of the `proxySource` attribute, and sets `useProxy` to `true`.

It does not preserve the interpretation parameters, instead using the user preferences.
If any file has an unlabeled alpha channel, and the user preference says to ask the user what to do, the method estimates the alpha interpretation, rather than asking the user.

#### Parameters

|      Parameter      |                                                 Type                                                  |                       Description                       |

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### AVItem.setProxyWithSolid()

`app.project.item(index).setProxyWithSolid(color, name, width, height, pixelAspect)`

#### Description

Creates a [SolidSource object](../sources/solidsource.md) with specified values, sets this as the value of the `proxySource` attribute, and sets `useProxy` to `true`. It does not preserve the interpretation parameters, instead using the user preferences.

!!! note
    There is no way, using the user interface, to set a solid as a proxy; this feature is available only through scripting.

#### Parameters

# Layer object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index)`

#### Description

The Layer object provides access to layers within compositions. It can be accessed from an item's layer collection either by index number or by a name string.

!!! info
    Layer is a subclass of [PropertyGroup](../property/propertygroup.md), which is a subclass of [PropertyBase](../property/propertybase.md). All methods and attributes of PropertyGroup, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with Layer, with the exception that `propertyIndex` attribute is set to `undefined`.

!!! info
    Layer is the base class for [CameraLayer object](cameralayer.md), [LightLayer object](lightlayer.md), and [AVLayer object](avlayer.md), so Layer attributes and methods are available when working with all layer types. Layers contain AE properties, in addition to their JavaScript attributes and methods. For examples of how to access properties in layers, see [PropertyBase object](../property/propertybase.md).

#### Example

If the first item in the project is a [CompItem](../item/compitem.md), this example disables the first layer in that composition and renames it. This might, for example, turn an icon off in the composition.

```javascript
var firstLayer = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
firstLayer.enabled = false;
firstLayer.name = "DisabledLayer";
```

Predefined animation preset files are installed in the Presets folder, and users can create new animation presets through the user interface.

!!! warning
    The animation preset is applied to the the selected layer(s) of the comp, not to the layer whose applyPreset function is called. Hence, the layer whose applyPreset function is called effectively just determines the comp whose layers are processed.

#### Parameters

|  Parameter   |                                                 Type                                                  |                Description                |

Creates a new Layer object with the same values as this one, and prepends the new object to the [LayerCollection object](layercollection.md) in the target CompItem. Retrieve the copy using into `Comp.layer(1)`.

Copying in a layer changes the index positions of previously existing layers in the target composition.

This is the same as copying and pasting a layer through the user interface.

!!! note
    As of After Effects 13.6, this method no longer causes After Effects to crash when the layer has a parent.

!!! warning
    As of After Effects 13.7 (13.6, has not been tested), if the copied layer has an effect on it and the user undoes the action, After Effects will Crash.

#### Parameters

| Parameter  |                  Type                  |       Description       |

### Layer.duplicate()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).duplicate()`

#### Description

Duplicates the layer. Creates a new Layer object in which all values are the same as in this one. This has the same effect as selecting a layer in the user interface and choosing Edit > Duplicate, except the selection in the user interface does not change when you call this method.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Layer object.

---

### Layer.moveAfter()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).moveAfter(layer)`

#### Description

Moves this layer to a position immediately after (below) the specified layer.

#### Parameters

| --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `layer`   | [Layer object](layer.md) | The target layer in the same composition. |


#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### Layer.moveBefore()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).moveBefore(layer)`

#### Description

Moves this layer to a position immediately before (above) the specified layer.

#### Parameters

| Parameter |           Type           |                Description                |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `layer`   | [Layer object](layer.md) | The target layer in the same composition. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

### Layer.moveToBeginning()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).moveToBeginning()`

#### Description

Moves this layer to the topmost position of the layer stack (the first layer).

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### Layer.moveToEnd()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).moveToEnd()`

#### Description

Moves this layer to the bottom position of the layer stack (the last layer).

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### Layer.remove()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).remove()`

#### Description

Deletes the specified layer from the composition.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### Layer.setParentWithJump()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).setParentWithJump([newParent])`

#### Description

Sets the parent of this layer to the specified layer, without changing the transform values of the child layer.

There may be an apparent jump in the rotation, translation, or scale of the child layer, as this layer's transform values are combined with those of its ancestors.

If you do not want the child layer to jump, set the [parent](#layerparent) attribute directly. In this case, an offset is calculated and set in the child layer's transform fields, to prevent the jump from occurring.

#### Parameters

|  Parameter  |           Type           |                                       Description                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `newParent` | [Layer object](layer.md) | Optional. A layer in the same composition. If not specified, it sets the parent to None. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

# LayerCollection object

`app.project.item(index).layers`

#### Description

The LayerCollection object represents a set of layers. The LayerCollection belonging to a [CompItem object](../item/compitem.md) contains all the layer objects for layers in the composition. The methods of the collection object allow you to manipulate the layer list.

!!! info
    LayerCollection is a subclass of [Collection object](../other/collection.md). All methods and attributes of Collection, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with LayerCollection.

#### Example

Given that the first item in the project is a CompItem and the second item is an AVItem, this example shows the number of layers in the CompItem's layer collection, adds a new layer based on an AVItem in the project, then displays the new number of layers.

```javascript
var firstComp = app.project.item(1);
var layerCollection = firstComp.layers;
alert("number of layers before is " + layerCollection.length);
var anAVItem = app.project.item(2);
layerCollection.add(anAVItem);
alert("number of layers after is " + layerCollection.length);
```

### AVLayer.canAddToMotionGraphicsTemplate()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).canAddToMotionGraphicsTemplate(comp)`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 18.0 (2021)

#### Description

Test whether or not the layer can be added to the Essential Graphics Panel for the specified composition.

Returns `true` if the layer can be added, or otherwise `false`.

If the layer cannot be added, it is either because it is not a layer type for which media can be replaced (referred to as Media Replacement Layers), or the layer has already been added to the EGP for that composition.

Media Replacement layers are recognized as AVLayers with an [AVLayer.source](#avlayersource) set to a [FootageItem object](../item/footageitem.md) (with specific source types) or a [CompItem object](../item/compitem.md).

The AVLayer needs to comply with the restrictions below in order to be treated as a Media Replacement layer:

- [Layer.hasVideo](../layer/layer.md#layerhasvideo) should return `true`.
- [AVLayer.adjustmentLayer](#avlayeradjustmentlayer) should return `false`.
- [Layer.nullLayer](../layer/layer.md#layernulllayer) should return `false`.
- If the [AVLayer.source](#avlayersource) is a [FootageItem object](../item/footageitem.md), then FootageItem.FootageSource should not be a [SolidSource object](../sources/solidsource.md).
- If the [AVLayer.source](#avlayersource) is a [FootageItem object](../item/footageitem.md) and the FootageItem.FootageSource is a [FileSource object](../sources/filesource.md) then that FileSource should not point to a non-media file e.g. a JSX script file.

#### Parameters

| Parameter |                  Type                   |                          Description                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `comp`    | [CompItem object](../item/compitem.md) | The composition where you wish to add the property to the EGP. |

#### Returns

Boolean.

### AVLayer.removeTrackMatte()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).removeTrackMatte()`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 23.0

#### Description

Removes the track matte for this layer while preserving the TrackMatteType.
See [AVLayer.setTrackMatte()](#avlayersettrackmatte) for another way of removing track matte.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

```javascript
// Sets the track matte layer of myLayer with otherLayer as LUMA type
myLayer.setTrackMatte(otherLayer, TrackMatteType.LUMA);

// Removes the track matte for myLayer but preserves the LUMA type

An AE property is a value, often animatable, of an effect, mask, or transform within an individual layer. For examples of how to access properties, see [PropertyBase object](propertybase.md) and [PropertyGroup.property()](propertygroup.md#propertygroupproperty).

!!! info
    Property is a subclass of [PropertyBase](propertybase.md). All methods and attributes of PropertyBase, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with Property.

!!! note
    JavaScript objects commonly referred to as "properties" are called "attributes" in this guide, to avoid confusion with the After Effects definition of property.

#### Examples

Get and set the value of opacity:
```javascript
var myProperty = myLayer.opacity;
// opacity has propertyValueType of OneD, and is stored as a float
myProperty.setValue(50); //set opacity to 50%
// Variable my Opacity is a float value
var myOpacity = myProperty.value;
```

Get and set the value of a position:

```javascript
var myProperty = myLayer.position;
// position has propertyValueType of ThreeD_SPATIAL, and is stored as an array of 3 floats
myProperty.setValue([10.0, 30.0, 0.0]);
// Variable my Position is an array of 3 floats
var myPosition = myProperty.value;
```

Change the value of a mask shape to be open instead of closed:

```javascript
var myMask = mylayer.mask(1);
var myProperty = myMask.maskPath;
myShape = myProperty.value;
myShape.closed = false;
myProperty.setValue(myShape);
```

Get the value of a color at a particular time. A color is stored as an array of four floats, `[r, g, b, opacity]`. This sets the value of the red component of a light's color at time 4 to be half of that at time 2:

```javascript
var myProperty = myLight.color;
var colorValue = myProperty.valueAtTime(2, true);
colorValue[0] = 0.5 * colorValue[0];
myProperty.setValueAtTime(4, colorValue);
```

Check that a scale calculated by an expression at time 3.5 is the expected value of [10,50]:

```javascript
var myProperty = myLayer.scale;
// false value of preExpression means evaluate the expression
var scaleValue = myProperty.valueAtTime(3.5, false);

if (scaleValue[0] === 10 && scaleValue[1] === 50) {
    alert("hurray");
} else {
    alert("oops");
}
```

Keyframe a rotation from 0 to 90 and back again. The animation is 10 seconds, and the middle keyframe is at the 5 second mark. Rotation properties are stored as a OneD value:

```javascript
var myProperty = myLayer.rotation;
myProperty.setValueAtTime(0, 0);
myProperty.setValueAtTime(5, 90);
myProperty.setValueAtTime(10, 0);
```

Change the key frame values for the first three keyframes of some sourcetext:

```javascript
var myProperty = myTextLayer.sourceText;
if (myProperty.numKeys < 3) {
    alert("error, I thought there were 3 keyframes");
} else {
    myProperty.setValueAtKey(1, newTextDocument("keynumber1"));
    myProperty.setValueAtKey(2, newTextDocument("keynumber2"));
    myProperty.setValueAtKey(3, newTextDocument("keynumber3"));
}
```

Set values using the convenience syntax for position, scale, color, or source text:

```javascript
// These two are equivalent. The second fills in a default of 0.
myLayer.position.setValue([20, 30, 0]);
myLayer.position.setValue([20, 30]);
// These two are equivalent. The second fills in a defaultof 100.
myLayer.scale.setValue([50, 50, 100]);
myLayer.scale.setValue([50, 50]);
// These two are equivalent. The second fills in a defaultof 1.0
myLight.color.setValue([0.8, 0.3, 0.1, 1.0]);
myLight.color.setValue([0.8, 0.3, 0.1]);
// These two are equivalent. The second creates a TextDocument
myTextLayer.sourceText.setValue(newTextDocument("foo"));
myTextLayer.sourceText.setValue("foo");
```

## Attributes

### Property.alternateSource

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.alternateSource`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 18.0 (2021)

#### Description

The value is `null` when:

- The alternate source is not set for the associated layer.
- The property cannot be used to set an alternate source.

Use [Property.canSetAlternateSource](#propertycansetalternatesource) to determine if the property is a Media Replacement Essential Property.

All Media Replacement Layers have an alternate source item that can be set.

A layer is "marked" for media replacement when the layer is added to the Essential Graphics Panel (see [AVLayer.addToMotionGraphicsTemplate()](../layer/avlayer.md#avlayeraddtomotiongraphicstemplate) or [AVLayer.addToMotionGraphicsTemplateAs()](../layer/avlayer.md#avlayeraddtomotiongraphicstemplateas)).

- If present, the render workflow will pick up the alternate source while rendering the layer.
- If the alternate source for the layer is not set, then the source layer of the Media Replacement control is used for rendering (this is the normal workflow).

Use [Property.setAlternateSource()](#propertysetalternatesource) to change the value.

#### Type

AVItem object; read-only.

---

### Property.canSetAlternateSource

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.canSetAlternateSource`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 18.0 (2021)

#### Description

Test whether the property is an Essential Property that supports Media Replacement.

Returns `true` if the property allows Media Replacement, otherwise `false`.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### Property.canSetExpression

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.canSetExpression`

#### Description

When `true`, the named property is of a type whose expression can be set by a script. See also [Property expression](#propertyexpression) attribute.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### Property.canVaryOverTime

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.canVaryOverTime`

#### Description

When `true`, the named property can vary over time—that is, keyframe values or expressions can be written to this property.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### Property.dimensionsSeparated

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.dimensionsSeparated`

#### Description

When `true`, the property's dimensions are represented as separate properties. For example, if the layer's position is represented as X Position and Y Position properties in the Timeline panel, the Position property has this attribute set to `true`.

!!! tip
    This attribute applies only when the [isSeparationLeader](#propertyisseparationleader) attribute is `true`.

#### Type

Boolean; read/write.

---

### Property.essentialPropertySource

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).essentialProperty.property(index).essentialPropertySource`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 22.0 (2022)

#### Description

Instance property on an Essential Property object which returns the original source Property which was used to create the Essential Property.

#### Type

Can be either:

- A read/write [Property object](#property-object), in the case that the source object used to create the Essential Property was a Property
- A read/write [AVLayer object](../layer/avlayer.md), in the case that the source object used to create the Essential Property was a Media Replacement Footage item
- `null` if called on a non-Essential Property

#### Example

```javascript

### Property.propertyValueType

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyValueType`

#### Description

The type of value stored in the named property. The `PropertyValueType` enumeration has one value for each type of data that can be stored in or retrieved from a property. Each type of data is stored and retrieved in a different kind of structure. All property objects store data according to one of these categories. For example, a 3D spatial property (such as a layer's position) is stored as an array of three floating-point values. When setting a value for position, pass in such an array, as follows: `mylayer.property("position").setValue([10, 20, 0]);`

In contrast, a shape property (such as a layer's mask shape) is stored as a Shape object. When setting a value for a shape, pass a Shape object, as follows:

```javascript
var myShape = new Shape();
myShape.vertices = [[0,0], [0,100], [100,100], [100,0]];
var myMask = mylayer.property("ADBE Mask Parade").property(1);
myMask.property("ADBE Mask Shape").setValue(myShape);
```

#### Type

A `PropertyValueType` enumerated value; read/write. One of:

- `PropertyValueType.NO_VALUE`: Stores no data.
- `PropertyValueType.ThreeD_SPATIAL`: Array of three floating-point positional values. For example, an Anchor Point value might be [10.0, 20.2, 0.0]
- `PropertyValueType.ThreeD`: Array of three floating-point quantitative values. For example, a Scale value might be [100.0, 20.2, 0.0]
- `PropertyValueType.TwoD_SPATIAL`: Array of 2 floating-point positional values. For example, an Anchor Point value might be [5.1, 10.0]
- `PropertyValueType.TwoD`: Array of 2 floating-point quantitative values. For example, a Scale value might be [5.1, 100.0]
- `PropertyValueType.OneD`: A floating-point value.
- `PropertyValueType.COLOR`:Array of 4 floating-point values in the range `[0.0..1.0]`. For example, [0.8, 0.3, 0.1, 1.0]
- `PropertyValueType.CUSTOM_VALUE` : Custom property value, such as the Histogram property for the Levels effect.
- `PropertyValueType.MARKER`: [MarkerValue object](../other/markervalue.md)

+-----------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

!!! tip
    Item strings should be in ASCII or MultiByte encodable in the current code-page. In other words, the item strings should be provided in the script of the running system.

    For example: Specifying the item strings in Japanese while running the script on an English system will create a dropdown effect with illegible characters in the item strings.

#### Example

```javascript
var dropdownItems = [
    "First Item",
    "Second Item",
    "(-",
    "Another Item",
    "Last Item"
];

var dropdownEffect = layer.property("ADBE Effect Parade").addProperty("ADBE Dropdown Control");
dropdownEffect.property(1).setPropertyParameters(dropdownItems);
```

#### Returns

Property object, the updated Dropdown Menu Control's Menu property.

    As After Effects 13.6, this method now waits for time-intensive expressions, like `sampleImage`, to finish evaluating before it returns the result.

#### Parameters

|    Parameter    |         Type         |                                                                                                                                        Description                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time`          | Floating-point value | The time, in seconds, at which to set the value. The beginning of the composition is 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `preExpression` | Boolean              | If the property has an expression and this is `true`, return the value for the specified time without applying the expression to it. When `false`, return the result of evaluating the expression for the specified time. Ignored if the property does not have an associated expression. |

#### Returns

A value appropriate for the type of the property (see "Property propertyValueType attribute" on page 138).

# PropertyBase object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec`

#### Description

Properties are accessed by name through layers, using various kinds of expression syntax, as controlled by application preferences. For example, the following are all ways of access properties in the Effects group

```javascript
var effect1 = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect("AddGrain")("Viewing Mode");
var effect1again = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect.addGrain.viewingMode;
var effect1againtoo = app.project.item(1).layer(1)("Effects").addGrain.viewingMode;
var effect1againtoo2 = app.project.item(1).layer(1)("Effects")("Add Grain")("Viewing Mode");
```

See also [PropertyGroup.property()](propertygroup.md#propertygroupproperty).

!!! info
    PropertyBase is the base class for both [Property](property.md) and [PropertyGroup](propertygroup.md), so PropertyBase attributes and methods are available when working with properties and property groups.

#### Reference invalidation

When something occurs that changes an object sufficiently for the reference to become invalid, script references to that object can generate errors. In simple cases this is straightforward. For example, if you delete anobject, a reference to the deleted object generates the warning "Object is Invalid":

```javascript
var layer1 = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
layer1.remove();
alert(layer1.name); // invalid reference to deleted object
```

Similarly, if you reference an AE property in a deleted object, the warning occurs

```javascript
var layer1 = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
var layer1position = layer1.transform.position;
layer1.remove();
alert(layer1position.value); // invalid reference to property inselected object
```

A less straightforward case is when a property is removed from a property group. In this case, After Effectsgenerates the "Object is Invalid" error when you subsequently reference that item or other items in the group,because their index positions have changed. For example:

```javascript
var effect1 = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect(1);
var effect2 = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect(2);
var effect2param = app.project.item(1).layer(1).effect(2).blendWithOriginal;
effect1.remove();
alert(effect2.name); // invalid reference because group index positions have changed
```

## Attributes

### PropertyBase.active

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).active`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.active`


#### Description

For a layer, this corresponds to the setting of the eyeball icon. When `true`, the layer's video is active at the current time. For this to be `true`, the layer must be enabled, no other layer may be soloing unless this layer is soloed too, and the time must be between the `inPoint` and `outPoint` values of this layer.

This value is never `true` in an audio layer; there is a separate `audioActive` attribute in the AVLayer object [AVLayer.audioActive](../layer/avlayer.md#avlayeraudioactive).

For an effect and all properties, it is the same as the enabled attribute, except that it's read-only.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.canSetEnabled

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.canSetEnabled`

#### Description

When `true`, you can set the `enabled` attribute value. Generally, this is `true` if the user interface displays an eyeball icon for this property; it is `true` for all layers.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.elided

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.elided`

#### Description

When `true`, this property is a group used to organize other properties. The property is not displayed in the user interface and its child properties are not indented in the Timeline panel.For example, for a text layer with two animators and no properties twirled down, you might see:

- `Text`
- `PathOptions`
- `MoreOptions`
- `Animator1`
- `Animator2`

In this example, "Animator 1" and "Animator 2" are contained in a PropertyBase called "Text Animators." This parent group is not displayed in the user interface, and so the two child properties are not indented in the Timeline panel.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.enabled

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).enabled`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.enabled`


#### Description

For layer, this corresponds to the video switch state of the layer in the Timeline panel. For an effect and all properties, it corresponds to the setting of the eyeball icon, if there is one.

When `true`, the layer or property is enabled; otherwise `false`.

#### Type

Boolean; read/write if `canSetEnabled` is `true`, read-only if `canSetEnabled` is `false`.

---

### PropertyBase.isEffect

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.isEffect`

#### Description

When `true`, this property is an effect PropertyGroup.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.isMask

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.isMask`

#### Description

When `true`, this property is a mask PropertyGroup.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.isModified

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.isModified`

#### Description

When `true`, this property has been changed since its creation.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.matchName

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.matchName`

#### Description

A special name for the property used to build unique naming paths. The match name is not displayed, but you can refer to it in scripts. Every property has a unique match-name identifier. Match names are stable from version to version regardless of the display name (the name attribute value) or any changes to the application. Unlike the display name, it is not localized. An indexed group may not have a name value, but always has a matchName value. (An indexed group has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#propertybasepropertytype).)

#### Type

String; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.name

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).name`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.name`


#### Description

For a layer, the name of the layer. By default, this is the same as the Source name, unless [Layer.isNameSet](../layer/layer.md#layerisnameset) returns `false`.

For an effect and all properties - the display name of the property. (Compare [PropertyBase.matchName](#propertybasematchname).) It is an error to set the name value if the property is not a child of an indexed group (that is, a property group that has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#propertybasepropertytype)).

#### Type

String; read/write for a child of an indexed group; otherwise read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.parentProperty

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.parentProperty`

#### Description

The property group that is the immediate parent of this property, or `null` if this PropertyBase is a layer.

#### Type

PropertyGroup object or `null`; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.propertyDepth

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyDepth`

#### Description

The number of levels of parent groups between this property and the containing layer. The value 0 for a layer.

#### Type

Integer; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.propertyIndex

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyIndex`

#### Description

The position index of this property within its parent group, if it is a child of an indexed group (a property group that has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#propertybasepropertytype)).

#### Type

Integer; read-only.

---

### PropertyBase.propertyType

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyType`

#### Description

The type of this property.

#### Type

A `PropertyType` enumerated value; read/write. One of:

- `PropertyType.PROPERTY`: A single property such as position or zoom.
- `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`: A property group whose members have an editable name and an index. Effects and masks are indexed groups. For example, the masks property of a layer refers to a variable number of individual masks by index number.
- `PropertyType.NAMED_GROUP`: A property group in which the member names are not editable. Layers are named groups.

---

### PropertyBase.selected

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.selected`

#### Description

When `true`, this property is selected. Set to `true` to select the property, or to `false` to deselect it. Sampling this attribute repeatedly for a large number of properties can slow down system performance. To read the full set of selected properties of a composition or layer, use either [CompItem.selectedProperties](../item/compitem.md#compitemselectedproperties) or [Layer.selectedProperties](../layer/layer.md#layerselectedproperties).

#### Type

Boolean; read/write.

## Methods

### PropertyBase.duplicate()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.duplicate()`

#### Description

If this property is a child of an indexed group, creates and returns a new PropertyBase object with the same attribute values as this one. If this property is not a child of an indexed group, the method generates an exception and displays an error. An indexed group has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#propertybasepropertytype).

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

PropertyBase object.

---

### PropertyBase.moveTo()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.moveTo(newIndex)`

#### Description

Moves this property to a new position in its parent property group. This method is valid only for children of indexed groups; if it is not, or if the index value is not valid, the method generates an exception and displays an error. (An indexed group has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#propertybasepropertytype).)

!!! warning
    Using this method invalidates existing references to other children in the same indexed group. For example, if you have three effects on a layer, each effect assigned to a different variable, moving one of the effects invalidates the references for all of these variables. You will need to reassign them.

#### Parameters

| Parameter  |  Type   |                             Description                              |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `newIndex` | Integer | The new index position at which to place this property in its group. |

#### Returns

Nothing.

---

### PropertyBase.propertyGroup()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.propertyGroup([countUp])`

#### Description

Gets the PropertyGroup object for an ancestor group of this property at a specified level of the parent-child hierarchy.

#### Parameters

| Parameter |                    Type                    |                                                        Description                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `countUp` | Integer, in the range `[1..propertyDepth]` | Optional. The number of levels to ascend within the parent-child hierarchy. Default is 1, which gets the immediate parent. |

#### Returns

PropertyGroup object, or [Layer object](../layer/layer.md) if the count reaches the containing layer.

#### Example

```javascript
var containing_layer = my_property.propertyGroup(my_property.propertyDepth);
```

---

### PropertyBase.remove()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertySpec.remove()`

#### Description

Removes this property from its parent group. If this is a property group, it removes the child properties as well. This method is valid only for children of indexed groups; if it is not, or if the index value is not valid, the method generates an exception and displays an error. (An indexed group has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](#propertybasepropertytype).) This method can be called on a text animation property (that is, any animator that has been set to a text layer).

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

Nothing.

# PropertyGroup object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec`

#### Description

The PropertyGroup object represents a group of properties. It can contain Property objects and other PropertyGroup objects. Property groups can be nested to provide a parent-child hierarchy, with a Layer object at the top (root) down to a single Property object, such as the mask feather of the third mask. To traverse the group hierarchy, use PropertyBase methods and attributes; see [PropertyBase.propertyGroup()](propertybase.md#propertybasepropertygroup). For examples of how to access properties and property groups, see [PropertyBase object](propertybase.md).

!!! info
    PropertyGroup is a subclass of [PropertyBase](propertybase.md). All methods and attributes of PropertyBase, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with PropertyGroup.

!!! info
    PropertyGroup is a base class for [Layer](../layer/layer.md) and [MaskPropertyGroup](maskpropertygroup.md). PropertyGroup attributes and methods are available when working with layer or mask groups.

---

## Attributes

### PropertyGroup.numProperties

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.numProperties`

#### Description

The number of indexed properties in this group.

For layers, this method returns a value of 3, corresponding to the mask, effect, and motion tracker groups, which are the indexed groups within the layer.

However, layers also have many other properties available only by name; see [PropertyGroup.property()](#propertygroupproperty).

#### Type

Integer; read-only.

---

## Methods

### PropertyGroup.addProperty()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.addProperty(name)`

#### Description

Creates and returns a PropertyBase object with the specified name, and adds it to this group.

In general, you can only add properties to an indexed group (a property group that has the type `PropertyType.INDEXED_GROUP`; see [PropertyBase.propertyType](propertybase.md#propertybasepropertytype)).
The only exception is a text animator property, which can be added to a named group (a property group that has the type `PropertyType.NAMED_GROUP`).

If this method cannot create a property with the specified name, it generates an exception.

To check that you can add a particular property to this group, call `canAddProperty` before calling this method. (See [PropertyGroup.canAddProperty()](#propertygroupcanaddproperty).)

!!! warning
    When you add a new property to an indexed group, the indexed group gets recreated from scratch, invalidating all existing references to properties.

One workaround is to store the index of the added property with property.propertyIndex.

#### Examples


This won't work, as the slider object becomes invalid once we add the Color Control property:

```javascript
var effectsProperty = layer.property("ADBE Effect Parade");
var slider = effectsProperty.addProperty("ADBE Slider Control");
var color = effectsProperty.addProperty("ADBE Color Control");

var sliderProperty = slider.property("ADBE Slider Control-0001"); // Object 'slider' is Invalid
```

This revised method will work:

```javascript
var effectsProperty = layer.property("ADBE Effect Parade");
var slider = effectsProperty.addProperty("ADBE Slider Control");
var sliderIndex = slider.propertyIndex; // Store 'slider' effect index so it can be reused later
var color = effectsProperty.addProperty("ADBE Color Control");

var sliderProperty = effectsProperty.property(sliderIndex).property("ADBE Slider Control-0001");
```

#### Parameters

### PropertyGroup.canAddProperty()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.canAddProperty(name)`

#### Description

Returns `true` if a property with the given name can be added to this property group.

For example, you can only add mask to a mask group. The only legal input arguments are "mask" or "ADBE Mask Atom".

```javascript
maskGroup.canAddProperty("mask"); // returns `true`
maskGroup.canAddProperty("ADBE Mask Atom"); // returns `true`
maskGroup.canAddProperty("blend"); // returns false
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter |  Type  |                                                          Description                                                          |

### PropertyGroup.addVariableFontAxis()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.addVariableFontAxis(axisTag)`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects (Beta) 26.0 and is subject to change while it remains in Beta.

#### Description

Creates and returns a Property object for a variable font axis, and adds it to this property group. This method can only be called on the "ADBE Text Animator Properties" property group within a text animator.

Common axis tags include (but are not limited to):

- `"wght"` - Weight (100-900 typical range)
- `"wdth"` - Width (percentage of normal width)
- `"slnt"` - Slant (angle in degrees)
- `"ital"` - Italic (0-1 range)
- `"opsz"` - Optical Size (point size)

Fonts may also include custom axes with 4-character uppercase tags (e.g., `"INFM"` for Informality).

#### Variable Font Spacing

When animating Variable Font axes, individual characters can change width. The Variable Font Spacing property (found in the "More Options" section of a text animator) controls how After Effects handles character spacing compensation for these width changes.

The Variable Font Spacing property can be accessed via its matchName `"ADBE Text Variable Font Spacing"` and is a dropdown control property. This property appears only when at least one variable font axis is active in the animator.


!!! tip
    Axes must exist on the font to have any impact. To discover what axes a font supports, use [FontObject.designAxesData](../text/fontobject.md#fontobjectdesignaxesdata).

#### Parameters

| Parameter |  Type  |                                              Description                                               
| --------- | ------ | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `axisTag` | String | The 4-character tag identifying the variable font axis (e.g., `"wght"`, `"wdth"`, `"slnt"`, `"ital"`).

#### Returns

[Property object](property.md) representing the variable font axis.

#### Examples

```javascript
// Create a comp
var comp = app.project.items.addComp("Create Axis Comp", 1920, 1080, 1, 30, 30);
comp.openInViewer();

// Create a text layer
var textLayer = comp.layers.addText("Hello World!");

// Set the font to variable font
var textDocument = textLayer.property("Source Text").value;
textDocument.font = 'ShantellSans'; // Must be a variable font
textLayer.property("Source Text").setValue(textDocument);

// Get the text property and animators group
var textProp = textLayer.property("Text");
var animators = textProp.property("Animators");

// Add a new animator
var animator = animators.addProperty("ADBE Text Animator");
var animatorProps = animator.property("ADBE Text Animator Properties");

// Add the Weight axis
var axisProp = animatorProps.addVariableFontAxis("wght");

// Set a static value
axisProp.setValue(700);

// Set keyframes
axisProp.setValueAtTime(0, 300);  // Light at 0 seconds
axisProp.setValueAtTime(2, 900);  // Heavy at 2 seconds
```

---

### PropertyGroup.property()

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.property(index)`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).propertyGroupSpec.property(name)`


#### Description

Finds and returns a child property of this group, as specified by either its index or name. A name specification can use the same syntax that is available with expressions. The following are all allowed and are equivalent:

```javascript
mylayer.position;
mylayer("position");
mylayer.property("position");
mylayer(1);
mylayer.property(1);
```

Some properties of a layer, such as position and zoom, can be accessed only by name. When using the name to find a property that is multiple levels down, you must make more than one call to this method.

For example, the following call searches two levels down, and returns the first mask in the mask group: `myLayer.property("ADBE Masks").property(1)`

#### Parameters

+-----------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter |  Type   |                                                Description                                                |
+===========+=========+===========================================================================================================+
| `index`   | Integer | The index for the child property, in the range `[1..numProperties]`, if this is an indexed group.         |

#### Examples

If a layer named "myLayer" has a Box Blur effect, you can retrieve the effect in any of the following ways:

```javascript
myLayer.property("Effects").property("Box Blur");
myLayer.property("Effects").property("boxBlur");
myLayer.property("Effects").property("ADBE Box Blur");
```

If a layer named "myLayer" has a mask named "Mask 1" you can retrieve it as follows:

```javascript
myLayer.property("Masks").property("Mask1");
```

To get a Bulge Center value from a Bulge effect, you can use either of the following:

#### Description

Calls the Queue In AME command. This method requires passing a boolean value, telling AME whether to only queue the render items (`false`) or if AME should also start processing its queue (`true`).

!!! note
    This requires Adobe Media Encoder CC 2017 (11.0) or later.

!!! tip
    When AME receives the queued items, it applies the most recently used encoding preset. If `render_immediately_in_AME` is set to `true`, you will not have an opportunity to change the encoding settings.

#### Parameters

|          Parameter          |  Type   |                                                       Description                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `render_immediately_in_AME` | Boolean | Telling AME whether to only queue the render items (`false`) or if AME should also start processing its queue (`true`). |

#### Returns

Nothing.

#### Example

The following sample code checks to see if there are queued items in the render queue, and if so queues them in AME but does not immediately start rendering:

```javascript
// Scripting support for Queue in AME.
// Requires Adobe Media Encoder 11.0.
if (app.project.renderQueue.canQueueInAME === true) {
    // Send queued items to AME, but do not start rendering.
    app.project.renderQueue.queueInAME(false);
} else {
    alert("There are no queued item in the Render Queue.");
}
```

### OutputModule.setSettings()

!!! warning
    There is a bug that causes OutputModule object to be invalidated after the output module setting is modified, so you need to retrieve the Output Module again after you modify it.

#### Examples

Get the settings from one item's output module and use them on another:

```javascript
// If you want to get the values in the number format, use
// GetSettingsFormat.NUMBER_SETTABLE as an argument.

var omItem1_settable_str = app.project.renderQueue.item(1).outputModule(1).getSettings( GetSettingsFormat.STRING_SETTABLE );

// Set output module item 1 of render queue item 2 with values that you get from
// output module 1 of render queue item 1

app.project.renderQueue.item(2).outputModule(1).setSettings( omItem1_settable_str );
```

Set output module item 1 of render queue item 3 with values that you create:

```javascript
var crop_data = {
    "Crop":        true,
    "Crop Bottom": 0,
    "Crop Left":   0,
    "Crop Right":  8,
    "Crop Top":    10
};

app.project.renderQueue.item(1).outputModule(3).setSettings( crop_data );
```

Route the output file to the user directory:

```javascript
var om1 = app.project.renderQueue.item(1).outputModule(1);
var file_name = File.decode( om1.file.name ); // Name contains special character, space?
var new_dir = new Folder( "~/new_output" );
var new_path = new_dir.fsName;

var new_data = {
    "Output File Info": {
        "Base Path":      new_path,
        "Subfolder Path": "draft",
        "File Name":      file_name
    }
};

om1.setSettings( new_data );
```

In this example, the output file is routed to the user directory, but this time using the full path:

```javascript
var om1 = app.project.renderQueue.item(1).outputModule(1);

// Name contains special character, such as space?
var file_name = File.decode( om1.file.name );
var new_path = "/Users/myAccount/new_output";
var separator = "/";

if ($.os.indexOf("Mac") == -1) {
    new_path = "C:\Users\myAccount\new_output";
    separator = "\\";
}

var new_data = {
    "Output File Info": {
        "Full Flat Path": new_path + separator + file_name
    }
};

om1.setSettings( new_data );
```

### FootageSource.conformFrameRate

`app.project.item(index).mainSource.conformFrameRate`

`app.project.item(index).proxySource.conformFrameRate`


#### Description

A frame rate to use instead of the `nativeFrameRate` value. If set to 0, the `nativeFrameRate` is used instead. It is an error to set this value if [FootageSource.isStill](#footagesourceisstill) is `true`. It is an error to set this value to 0 if [removePulldown](#footagesourceremovepulldown) is not set to `PulldownPhase.OFF`. If this is 0 when you set `removePulldown` to a value other than `PulldownPhase.OFF`, then this is automatically set to the value of `nativeFrameRate`.

    # SolidSource object

`app.project.item(index).mainSource`

`app.project.item(index).proxySource`


#### Description

!!! info
    SolidSource is a subclass of [FootageSource](footagesource.md). All methods and attributes of FootageSource, in addition to those listed below, are available when working with SolidSource.

---

## Attributes

### SolidSource.color

`solidSource.color`

#### Description

The color of the solid, expressed as red, green, and blue values.

#### Type

Array of three floating-point values, `[R, G, B]`, in the range `[0.0..1.0]`; read/write.


# CharacterRange object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).text.sourceText.value.characterRange(characterIndexStart, [signedCharacterIndexEnd])`


!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

The CharacterRange object is an accessor to a character range of the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) instance it was created from.

Unlike the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md), which looks at only the first character when returning character attributes, here the character range can span zero or more characters. As a consequence, two or more characters *may not have the same attribute value* and this mixed state will be signaled by returning `undefined`.

- The [characterStart](#characterrangecharacterstart) attribute is the first character index of the range.
- The [characterEnd](#characterrangecharacterend) attribue will report the (last + 1) character index of the range, such that ([characterEnd](#characterrangecharacterend) - [characterStart](#characterrangecharacterstart)) represents the number of characters in the range.

It is acceptable for most attributes for the effective range to be zero - otherwise known as an insertion point.

When accessed, the CharacterRange object will check that [characterStart](#characterrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#characterrangecharacterend) of the range remains valid for the current span of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md). This is the same rule as applied when the CharacterRange was created, but because the length of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) can change through the addition or removal of characters, the [characterStart](#characterrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#characterrangecharacterend) may no longer be valid. In this situation an exception will be thrown on access, either read or write. The [isRangeValid](#characterrangeisrangevalid) attribute will return `false` if the effective range is no longer valid.

Note that if the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) length changes, the [CharacterRange object](#characterrange-object) range could become valid again.

#### Differences from TextDocument

Because CharacterRange is an accessor of [TextDocument object](textdocument.md), most methods and attributes of TextDocument are available when working with CharacterRange. The attributes and methods that are unique to CharacterRange or exhibit unique behaviors are included on this page.

The following attributes and methods are **not** available on instances of CharacterRange:

|    Attributes     |            Methods            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `baselineLocs`    | `characterRange`              |
| `boxText`         | `paragraphCharacterIndexesAt` |
| `boxTextPos`      | `paragraphRange`              |
| `boxTextSize`     |                               |
| `lineOrientation` |                               |
| `paragraphCount`  |                               |
| `pointText`       |                               |

#### Examples

This increases the font size of the first character in the TextDocument, and set the rest of the characters to fontSize 40.

```javascript
var textDocument = app.project.item(index).layer(index).property("Source Text").value;
var characterRange = textDocument.characterRange(0,1);

characterRange.fontSize = characterRange.fontSize + 5;
textDocument.characterRange(1,-1).fontSize = 40;
```

---

## Attributes

### CharacterRange.characterEnd

`CharacterRange.characterEnd`

#### Description

The Text layer range calculated character end value.

Throws an exception on access if the effective value would exceed the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md).

#### Type

Unsigned integer; read-only.

---

### CharacterRange.characterStart

`CharacterRange.characterStart`

#### Description

The Text layer range calculated character start value.

Throws an exception on access if the effective value would exceed the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md).

#### Type

Unsigned integer; read-only.

---

### CharacterRange.fillColor

`CharacterRange.fillColor`

#### Description

The Text layer range CharacterRange attribute Fill Color, as an array of `[r, g, b]` floating-point values.

For example, in an 8-bpc project, a red value of 255 would be 1.0, and in a 32-bpc project, an overbright blue value can be something like 3.2.

Setting this value will also set `applyFill` to `true` across the affected characters.

If this attribute has a mixed value for the range of characters, it will be read as `undefined`.

!!! warning
    In contrast to the same attribute on the TextDocument API, we will *not* throw an exception on read if `applyFill` is not `true`.

#### Type

Array `[r, g, b]` of floating-point values; read/write.

---

### CharacterRange.isRangeValid

`CharacterRange.isRangeValid`

#### Description

Returns `true` if the current range is within the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md), otherwise `false`.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

### CharacterRange.kerning

`CharacterRange.kerning`

#### Description

The Text layer range character attribute kerning option.

This effectively reports the manual kerning value, and not the calculated kerning value from auto kerning.

- If [autoKernType](textdocument.md#textdocumentautokerntype) in the range is set to `AutoKernType.METRIC_KERN`, `AutoKernType.OPTICAL_KERN`, or is mixed, then this attribute will be returned as `undefined`.
- If [autoKernType](textdocument.md#textdocumentautokerntype) in the range is set to `AutoKernType.NO_AUTO_KERN`, and this attribute has a mixed value, it will be read as `undefined`.

Setting this value will also set `AutoKernType.NO_AUTO_KERN` to `true` across the affected characters.

#### Type

Integer value; read/write.

---

### CharacterRange.strokeColor

`CharacterRange.strokeColor`

#### Description

The Text layer CharacterRange stroke color character property, as an array of [r, g, b] floating-point values.

For example, in an 8-bpc project, a red value of 255 would be 1.0, and in a 32-bpc project, an overbright blue value can be something like 3.2.

If this attribute has a mixed value, it will be read as `undefined`.

Setting this value will also set [applyStroke](textdocument.md#textdocumentapplystroke) to `true` across the affected characters.

!!! warning
    In contrast to the same attribute on the TextDocument API, we will *not* throw an exception on read if [applyStroke](textdocument.md#textdocumentapplystroke) is not `true`.

#### Type

Array [r, g, b] of floating-point values; read/write.

---

### CharacterRange.strokeOverFill

`CharacterRange.strokeOverFill`

#### Description

The Text layer CharacterRange Stroke Over Fill character property.

Indicates the rendering order for the fill and stroke for characters in the range. When `true`, the stroke appears over the fill.

If this attribute has a mixed value, it will be read as `undefined`.

!!! warning
    The Text layer can override per-character attribute setting via the All Strokes First or All Fills First setting on the CharPanel.

    The value returned here represents what is applied to the characters, without regard to the possible Text layer override.


#### Type

Boolean; read/write.

---

### CharacterRange.text

`CharacterRange.text`

#### Description

The text value for the Text layer range.

On read, the same number of characters as the span of the range will be returned. If the span is zero (an insertion point) it return an empty string.

On write, the characters in the range will be replaced with whatever string value is supplied. If an empty string, then the characters in the range will be effectively deleted.

To insert characters without deleting any existing, call [TextDocument.characterRange()](textdocument.md#textdocumentcharacterrange) with the same value for start as end to get an insertion point range.

#### Type

String; read/write.

---

## Methods

### CharacterRange.pasteFrom()

`CharacterRange.pasteFrom(characterRange)`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 25.1

#### Description

Copies, using paste semantics, from the `characterRange` parameter to the callee [CharacterRange object](#characterrange-object). The two instances may be the same, and the spans may be different.

Checks will be made that both [CharacterRange object](#characterrange-object) instances are valid.

The internal steps of the operation are:

- Delete the text from the target instance.
- Paste the text from the source instance.

As the span of the [CharacterRange object](#characterrange-object) is not adjusted by this call, when the source [CharacterRange object](#characterrange-object) instance has a shorter span than the target [CharacterRange object](#characterrange-object) instance, the target instance may become invalid.

#### Parameters

|    Parameter     |                      Type                       |                                                     Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `characterRange` | [CharacterRange object](#characterrange-object) | Object whose text and styling will be pasted in place of the callee [CharacterRange object](#characterrange-object). |

#### Returns

None.

---

### CharacterRange.toString()

`CharacterRange.toString()`

#### Description

Returns a string with the parameters used to create the CharacterRange instance, e.g. `"CharacterRange(0,-1)"`.

This may be safely called on an instance where isRangeValid returns `false`.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

String; read-only.

# ComposedLineRange object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).text.sourceText.value.composedLineRange(composedLineIndexStart, [signedComposedLineIndexEnd])`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

The ComposedLineRange object is an accessor to a composed line range of the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) instance it was created from.

Composed lines are initialized in the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) when it is created and remain unchanged while the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) is changed.
It is important to note that the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) instance is not recomposed when changes are made to it - that only occurs when the instance is applied back to a [TextLayer object](../layer/textlayer.md).
So if you delete all the text in the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) instance the number of composed lines will remain constant.

- The [characterStart](#composedlinerangecharacterstart) attribute will report the first character index of the range.
- The [characterEnd](#composedlinerangecharacterend) attribute will report the (last + 1) character index of the range, such that ([characterEnd](#composedlinerangecharacterend) - [characterStart](#composedlinerangecharacterstart)) represents the number of characters in the range.
- A composed line always has some length.

When accessed, the ComposedLineRange object will check that effective [characterStart](#composedlinerangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#composedlinerangecharacterend) of the range remains valid for the current span of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md). This is the same rule as applied when the ComposedLineRange was created, but because the length of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) can change through the addition or removal of characters, the effective [characterStart](#composedlinerangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#composedlinerangecharacterend) may no longer be valid. In this situation an exception will be thrown on access, either read or write. The property [isRangeValid](#composedlinerangeisrangevalid) will return `false` if the effective range is no longer valid.

Note that if the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) length changes, the character range could become valid again.

As a convenience, the function [ComposedLineRange.characterRange()](#composedlinerangecharacterrange) can be invoked which will return a [CharacterRange object](characterrange.md) instance initialized from [characterStart](#composedlinerangecharacterstart) and [characterEnd](#composedlinerangecharacterend).
This instance becomes independent of the ComposedLineRange instance it came from so subsequent changes to the ComposedLineRange limits are not communicated to the [CharacterRange object](characterrange.md) instance.

For performance reasons, when accessing multiple attributes it is adviseable to retrieve the [CharacterRange object](characterrange.md) once and re-use it rather than create a new one each time.

#### Examples

This changes the fill color to red of the first composed line in the TextDocument, and set the rest of the lines to color blue.

```javascript
var textDocument = app.project.item(index).layer(index).property("Source Text").value;

var composedLineRange0 = textDocument.composedLineRange(0,1);
var characterRange0 = composedLineRange0.characterRange();
characterRange0.fillColor = [1.0, 0, 0];

textDocument.composedLineRange(1,-1).characterRange().fillColor = [0, 0, 1.0];
```

---

---

### ComposedLineRange.isRangeValid

`ComposedLineRange.isRangeValid`

#### Description

Returns `true` if the current range is within the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md), otherwise `false`.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

## Methods

### ComposedLineRange.characterRange()

`ComposedLineRange.characterRange()`

#### Description

Returns a [CharacterRange object](characterrange.md) initialized from [characterStart](#composedlinerangecharacterstart) and [characterEnd](#composedlinerangecharacterend).

Will throw an exception if isRangeValid would return `false`.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

[CharacterRange object](characterrange.md);

---

### ComposedLineRange.toString()

`ComposedLineRange.toString()`

#### Description

Returns a string with the parameters used to create the ComposedLineRange instance, e.g. `"ComposedLineRange(0,-1)"`

This may be safely called on an instance where isRangeValid returns `false`.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

String;

# Font object

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.0

#### Description

The Font object provides information about a specific font, along with the font technology used, helping disambiguate when multiple fonts sharing the same Postscript name are installed on the system.

Most of these APIs simply return information which is contained in the Font data file itself, seek more information there.

---

## Attributes

### FontObject.designAxesData

#### Example

This example demonstrates how to see the axes of a variable font on a selected Text layer:

```javascript
// Prerequisite: Create and select a Text layer that uses a variable font
var textLayer = app.project.activeItem.selectedLayers[0];

// Get the font object
var textDocument = textLayer.property("Source Text").value;
var fontObject = textDocument.fontObject;

// Check for axes and display any that are found
if (fontObject && fontObject.designAxesData) {
    var axes = fontObject.designAxesData;
    var message = "Variable Font Axes (" + axes.length + " total):\n\n";
    
    for (var i = 0; i < axes.length; i++) {
        var axis = axes[i];
        message += "Axis " + (i + 1) + ":\n";
        message += "  Tag: " + axis.tag + "\n";
        message += "  Name: " + axis.name + "\n";
        message += "  Min: " + axis.min + "\n";
        message += "  Max: " + axis.max + "\n";
        message += "  Default: " + axis.default + "\n";
        
        if (i < axes.length - 1) {
            message += "\n";
        }

## Methods

### FontObject.hasGlyphsFor()

`app.fonts.allFonts[0][0].hasGlyphsFor(charString)`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 25.1

#### Description

Fonts do not contain glyphs for all possible ranges of Unicode and this method gives the caller the opportunity to query the Font about support for one or more characters.

Returns `true` if the font has a glyph for every character in the `charString`.

The character order does not matter, and in the case of a parameter string with more than one character, it is not possible though this API to determine which character had no glyph support.

#### Parameters

|  Parameter   |  Type  |                                Description                                |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `charString` | String | Text that will be checked for support in the [Font object](#font-object). |


#### Returns

Boolean.

---

### FontObject.hasSameDict()

`app.fonts.fontsWithDefaultDesignAxes[0].hasSameDict(fontObject)`

#### Description

This function will `true` if the [Font object](#font-object) passed as an argument shares the same variable font dictionary as the [Font object](#font-object) the function is called on.

!!! tip
    Can only return `true` when called on a variable [Font object](#font-object) with the argument also being a [Font object](#font-object) of a variable font.

#### Parameters

|  Parameter   |            Type             |   Description   |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| `fontObject` | [Font object](#font-object) | Object to check |

#### Returns

Boolean.

---


### FontObject.postScriptNameForDesignVector()

`app.fonts.fontsWithDefaultDesignAxes[0].postScriptNameForDesignVector([...vectorValues])`

#### Description

This function will return the postscript name of the variable font for the specific design vectors passed as the argument.

#### Parameters

|   Parameter    |              Type              |                                           Description                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vectorValues` | Array of floating-point values | Values to check [FontObject.designVector](#fontobjectdesignvector) for the given variable font. |

#### Returns

A String.


# ParagraphRange object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).text.sourceText.value.paragraphRange(paragraphIndexStart, [signedParagraphIndexEnd])`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

The ParagraphRange object is an accessor to a paragraph range of the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) instance it was created from.

- The [characterStart](#paragraphrangecharacterstart) attribute will report the first character index of the range.
- The [characterEnd](#paragraphrangecharacterend) attribute will report the (last + 1) character index of the range, such that ([characterEnd](#paragraphrangecharacterend) - [characterStart](#paragraphrangecharacterstart)) represents the number of characters in the range.
- The only time these two properties will equal will on an empty last paragraph of the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md).

When accessed, the ParagraphRange object will check that effective [characterStart](#paragraphrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#paragraphrangecharacterend) of the range remains valid for the current span of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md). This is the same rule as applied when the ParagraphRange was created, but because the length of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) can change through the addition or removal of characters, the effective [characterStart](#paragraphrangecharacterstart) and effective [characterEnd](#paragraphrangecharacterend) may no longer be valid. In this situation an exception will be thrown on access, either read or write. The [isRangeValid](#paragraphrangeisrangevalid) attribute will return `false` if the effective range is no longer valid.

Note that if the [TextDocument object](textdocument.md) length changes, the character range could become valid again.

As a convenience, the function [ParagraphRange.characterRange()](#paragraphrangecharacterrange) can be invoked which will return a [CharacterRange object](characterrange.md) instance initialized from [characterStart](#paragraphrangecharacterstart) and [characterEnd](#paragraphrangecharacterend).
This instance becomes independent of the ParagraphRange instance it came from so subsequent changes to the ParagraphRange limits are not communicated to the [CharacterRange object](characterrange.md) instance.

For performance reasons, when accessing multiple attributes it is adviseable to retrieve the [CharacterRange object](characterrange.md) once and re-use it rather than create a new one each time.

#### Examples

This increases the font size of the first paragraph in the TextDocument, and set the rest of the paragraphs to fontSize 40.

```javascript
var textDocument = app.project.item(index).layer(index).property("Source Text").value;

var paragraphRange0 = textDocument.paragraphRange(0,1);
var characterRange0 = paragraphRange0.characterRange();
characterRange0.fontSize = characterRange0.fontSize + 5;

textDocument.paragraphRange(1,-1).characterRange().fontSize = 40;
```

---

## Attributes

### ParagraphRange.characterEnd

`ParagraphRange.characterEnd`

#### Description

The Text layer range calculated character end value.

Throws an exception on access if the effective value would exceed the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md).

#### Type

Unsigned integer; read-only.

---

### ParagraphRange.characterStart

`ParagraphRange.characterStart`

#### Description

The Text layer range calculated character start value.

Throws an exception on access if the effective value would exceed the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md).

#### Type

Unsigned integer; read-only.

---

### ParagraphRange.isRangeValid

`ParagraphRange.isRangeValid`

#### Description

Returns `true` if the current range is within the bounds of the related [TextDocument object](textdocument.md), otherwise `false`.

#### Type

Boolean; read-only.

---

## Methods

### ParagraphRange.characterRange()

`ParagraphRange.characterRange()`

#### Description

Returns a [CharacterRange object](characterrange.md) initialized from [characterStart](#paragraphrangecharacterstart) and [characterEnd](#paragraphrangecharacterend).

Will throw an exception if [isRangeValid](#paragraphrangeisrangevalid) would return `false`.

The returned instance, once created, is independent of subsequent changes to the ParagraphRange it came from.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

[CharacterRange object](characterrange.md);

---

### ParagraphRange.toString()

`ParagraphRange.toString()`

#### Description

Returns a string with the parameters used to create the ParagraphRange instance, e.g. `"ParagraphRange(0,-1)"`

This may be safely called on an instance where [isRangeValid](#paragraphrangeisrangevalid) returns `false`.

#### Parameters

None.

#### Returns

String;

# TextDocument object

`new TextDocument(docText)`

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).property("Source Text").value`


#### Description

The TextDocument object stores a value for a TextLayer's Source Text property. Create it with the constructor, passing the string to be encapsulated.

#### Examples

This sets a value of some source text and displays an alert showing the new value.

```javascript
var myTextDocument = new TextDocument("HappyCake");
myTextLayer.property("Source Text").setValue(myTextDocument);
alert(myTextLayer.property("Source Text").value);
```

This sets keyframe values for text that show different words over time

```javascript
var textProp = myTextLayer.property("Source Text");
textProp.setValueAtTime(0, newTextDocument("Happy"));
textProp.setValueAtTime(.33, newTextDocument("cake"));
textProp.setValueAtTime(.66, newTextDocument("is"));
textProp.setValueAtTime(1, newTextDocument("yummy!"));
```

This sets various character and paragraph settings for some text

```javascript
var textProp = myTextLayer.property("Source Text");
var textDocument = textProp.value;
myString = "Happy holidays!";
textDocument.resetCharStyle();
textDocument.fontSize = 60;
textDocument.fillColor = [1, 0, 0];
textDocument.strokeColor = [0, 1, 0];
textDocument.strokeWidth = 2;
textDocument.font = "Times New Roman PSMT";
textDocument.strokeOverFill = true;
textDocument.applyStroke = true;
textDocument.applyFill = true;
textDocument.text = myString;
textDocument.justification = ParagraphJustification.CENTER_JUSTIFY;
textDocument.tracking = 50;
textProp.setValue(textDocument);
```

### TextDocument.paragraphCharacterIndexesAt()

`textDocument.paragraphCharacterIndexesAt(characterIndex)`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

Returns the character index bounds of a paragraph in the Text layer.

#### Parameters

|    Parameter     |       Type       |                                     Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `characterIndex` | Unsigned integer | A text index in the Text layer, which will be mapped to the paragraph it intersects. |

#### Returns

Generic object;

### TextDocument.paragraphRange()

`textDocument.paragraphRange(paragraphIndexStart, [signedParagraphIndexEnd])`

!!! note
    This functionality was added in After Effects 24.3

#### Description

Returns an instance of the Text layer range accessor [ParagraphRange object](paragraphrange.md).

The instance will remember the parameters passed in the constructor - they remain constant and changes to the [TextDocument](#textdocument-object) contents may cause the instance to throw exceptions on access until the [TextDocument](#textdocument-object) contents are changed which makes the range valid again.

Use [ParagraphRange.toString()](paragraphrange.md#paragraphrangetostring) to find out what the constructed parameters were.

# KeyframeEase object

`myKey = new KeyframeEase(speed, influence);`

#### Description

The KeyframeEase object encapsulates the keyframe ease settings of a layer's AE property. Keyframe ease is determined by the speed and influence values that you set using the property's [setTemporalEaseAtKey](../property/property.md#propertysettemporaleaseatkey) method. The constructor creates a KeyframeEase object. Both parameters are required.

- `speed`: A floating-point value. Sets the `speed` attribute.
- `influence`: A floating-pointvalue in the range `[0.1..100.0]`. Sets the `influence` attribute.

#### Example

This example assumes that the Position, a spatial property, has more than two keyframes.

```javascript
var easeIn = new KeyframeEase(0.5, 50);
var easeOut = new KeyframeEase(0.75, 85);
var myPositionProperty = app.project.item(1).layer(1).property("Position");
myPositionProperty.setTemporalEaseAtKey(2, [easeIn], [easeOut]);
```

This example sets the Scale, a temporal property with either two or three dimensions. For 2D and 3D properties you must set an `easeIn` and `easeOut` value for each dimension:

```javascript
var easeIn = new KeyframeEase(0.5, 50);
var easeOut = new KeyframeEase(0.75, 85);
var myScaleProperty = app.project.item(1).layer(1).property("Scale")
myScaleProperty.setTemporalEaseAtKey(2, [easeIn, easeIn, easeIn], [easeOut, easeOut, easeOut]);
```

---

## Attributes

### KeyframeEase.influence

`myKey.influence`

#### Description

The influence value of the keyframe, as shown in the Keyframe Velocity dialog box.

#### Type

Floating-point value, in the range `[0.1..100.0]`; read/write.

---

### KeyframeEase.speed

`myKey.speed`

#### Description

The speed value of the keyframe. The units depend on the type of keyframe, and are displayed in the Keyframe Velocity dialog box.

#### Type

Floating-point value; read/write.


# MarkerValue object

`new MarkerValue(comment, chapter, url, frameTarget, cuePointName, params)`

#### Description

The MarkerValue object represents a layer or composition marker, which associates a comment, and optionally a chapter reference point, Web-page link, or Flash Video cue point with a particular point in a layer.

Create it with the constructor; all arguments except `comment` are optional.

All arguments are strings that set in the corresponding attributes of the returned MarkerValue object, except `params`; this is an array containing key-value pairs, which can then be accessed with the [getParameters()](#markervaluegetparameters) and [setParameters()](#markervaluesetparameters) methods.

A script can set any number of parameter pairs; the order does not reflect the order displayed in the application.

To associate a marker with a layer, set the MarkerValue object in the [Layer.marker](../layer/layer.md#layermarker) property of the layer: `layerObject.property("Marker").setValueAtTime(time, markerValueObject);`

To associate a marker with a composition, set the MarkerValue object in the [CompItem.markerProperty](../item/compitem.md#compitemmarkerproperty) property of the comp: `compObject.markerProperty.setValueAtTime(time, markerValueObject);`

For information on the usage of markers see "Using markers" in After Effects Help.

#### Examples

- To set a **layer** marker that says "Fade Up" at the 2 second mark:
    ```javascript
    var myMarker = new MarkerValue("FadeUp");
    myLayer.property("Marker").setValueAtTime(2, myMarker);
    // or
    myLayer.marker.setValueAtTime(2, myMarker);
    ```

- To set a **comp** marker that says "Fade Up" at the 2 second mark:
    ```javascript
    var myMarker = new MarkerValue("FadeUp");
    comp.markerProperty.setValueAtTime(2, myMarker);
    ```

- To get comment values from a particular marker:
    ```javascript
    var layer = app.project.item(1).layer(1);
    var markerProperty = layer.marker;

    var commentOfFirstMarker = markerProperty.keyValue(1).comment;

    // or
    var commentOfMarkerAtTime4 = markerProperty.valueAtTime(4.0, true).comment;

    // or
    var markerValueAtTimeClosestToTime4 = markerProperty.keyValue(markerProperty.nearestKeyIndex(4.0));
    var commentOfMarkerClosestToTime4 = markerValueAtTimeClosestToTime4.comment;
    ```

# Preferences object

`app.preferences`

#### Description

The Preferences object provides an easy way to manage internal AE preferences, such as you'd find in AE's Preferences menu. These are saved in the After Effects preference files, and are persistent between application sessions.

Preferences are identified by section and key within the file, and each key name is associated with a value.

In the preferences file, section names are enclosed in brackets and quotation marks, and key names are listing in quotation marks below the sectionname. All values are strings.

You can create new preferences with this object, as well as accessing existing preferences.

As of Version 12/CC, preferences and settings methods now take a third argument to specify the target preferences file if Section/Key is not in "Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs.txt".

If the third argument is not passed, default value (`PREFType.PREF_Type_MACHINE_SPECIFIC`) is used and After Effects tries to save/get from the "Adobe After Effects $versionNumber.x Prefs.txt" preferences file.

# Settings object

`app.settings`

#### Description

The Settings object provides an easy way to manage settings for third-party scripts. The settings are saved in the main After Effects preferences file, and are persistent between application sessions.

Settings are identified by section and key within the file, and each key name is associated with a value.

In the settings file, section names are enclosed in brackets and quotation marks, and key names are listing in quotation marks below the sectionname. All values are strings.

You can create new settings with this object, as well as accessing existing settings.

As of Version 12/CC, preferences and settings methods now take a third argument to specify the target preferences file if Section/Key is not in the main preferences file. See [Preferences object](preferences.md) for more info.

!!! tip
    - These values aren't shared between versions of AE; each new install brings new settings files, and so these prefs won't carry over.
    - Internally, all saved settings have their section name preprended with `"Settings_"`
    - If you're looking to get or set internal AE preferences, see [Preferences object](preferences.md)

# Shape object

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).property(index).property("maskShape").value`

#### Description

The Shape object encapsulates information describing a shape in a shape layer, or the outline shape of a Mask. It is the value of the "Mask Path" AE properties, and of the "Path" AE property of a shape layer. Use the constructor, `new Shape()`, to create a new, empty Shape object, then set the attributes individually to define the shape.

A shape has a set of anchor points, or vertices, and a pair of direction handles, or tangent vectors, for each anchor point. A tangent vector (in a non-RotoBezier mask) determines the direction of the line that is drawn to or from an anchor point. There is one incoming tangent vector and one outgoing tangent vector associated with each vertex in the shape.

A tangent value is a pair of x,y coordinates specified relative to the associated vertex. For example, a tangent of [-1,-1] is located above and to the left of the vertex and has a 45 degree slope, regardless of the actual location of the vertex. The longer a handle is, the greater its influence; for example, an incoming shape segment stays closer to the vector for an `inTangent` of [-2,-2] than it does for an `inTangent` of [-1,-1], even though both of these come toward the vertex from the same direction.

If a shape is not closed, the `inTangent` for the first vertex and the `outTangent` for the final vertex are ignored. If the shape is closed, these two vectors specify the direction handles of the final connecting segment out of the final vertex and back into the first vertex.

RotoBezier masks calculate their tangents automatically. (See [MaskPropertyGroup.rotoBezier](../property/maskpropertygroup.md#maskpropertygrouprotobezier)) If a shape is used in a RotoBezier mask, the tangent values are ignored. This means that, for RotoBezier masks, you can construct a shape by setting only the `vertices` attribute and setting both `inTangents` and `outTangents` to `null`. When you access the new shape, its tangent values are filled with the automatically calculated tangent values.

For closed mask shapes, variable-width mask feather points can exist anywhere along the mask path. Feather points are part of the Mask Path property. Reference a specific feather point by the number of the mask path segment (portion of the path between adjacent vertices) where it appears.

!!! tip
    The feather points on a mask are listed in an array in the order that they were created.

#### Examples

- Create a square mask. A square is a closed shape with 4 vertices. The `inTangents` and `outTangents` for connected straight-line segments are 0, the default, and do not need to be explicitly set.
    ```javascript
    var myShape = new Shape();
    myShape.vertices = [[0,0], [0,100], [100,100], [100,0]];
    myShape.closed = true;
    ```
- Create a "U" shaped mask. A "U" is an open shape with the same 4 vertices used in the square.
    ```javascript
    var myShape = new Shape();
    myShape.vertices = [[0,0], [0,100], [100,100], [100,0]];
    myShape.closed = false;
    ```
- Create an oval. An oval is a closed shape with 4 vertices and with inTangent and outTangent values.
    ```javascript
    var myShape = new Shape();
    myShape.vertices = [[300,50], [200,150],[300,250],[400,150]];
    myShape.inTangents = [[55.23,0],[0,-55.23],[-55.23,0],[0,55.23]];
    myShape.outTangents = [[-55.23,0],[0,55.23],[55.23,0],[0,-55.23]];
    myShape.closed = true;
    ```
- Create a square mask with two feather points. A large square mask with two feather points, one closer to the left end the second mask segment (off the bottom edge) with a radius of 30 pixels and the other one centered the third mask segment (off the right edge) with a larger radius of 100 pixels.
    ```javascript
    var myShape = new Shape();
    myShape.vertices = [[100,100], [100,400], [400,400], [400,100]]; // segments drawn counter clockwise
    myShape.closed = true;
    myShape.featherSegLocs = [1, 2]; // segments are numbered starting at 0, so second segment is 1
    myShape.featherRelSegLocs = [0.15, 0.5]; // 0.15 is closer to the lower-left corner of the square
    myShape.featherRadii = [30, 100]; // second feather point (onright-sidesegment) has a larger radius
    ```
